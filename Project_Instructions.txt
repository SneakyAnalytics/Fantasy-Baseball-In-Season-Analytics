ESPN Fantasy Baseball Analyzer - Project Plan
Project Overview
This project aims to create a comprehensive analysis tool for ESPN Fantasy Baseball leagues. By leveraging the ESPN Fantasy API, we'll build a Python-based application that can extract data from your league, process it, and generate actionable insights to help with fantasy baseball decision-making.
Project Goals

Connect to ESPN Fantasy Baseball API to retrieve league data
Process and analyze team performance metrics
Generate player analysis reports
Provide statistical projections and recommendations
Create visualizations for easier data interpretation
Automate routine analysis tasks
