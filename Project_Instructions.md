## Additional Prospect features I would like to Build out

1. Prospect Monitoring System
   We can build a module that tracks top MLB prospects and their performance in the minor leagues:
   python

# src/analysis/prospect_analyzer.py

class ProspectAnalyzer:
"""Track and analyze top MLB prospects."""

    def __init__(self, client):
        self.client = client

    def get_top_prospects_performance(self):
        """Retrieve performance metrics for top prospects in AAA/AA."""
        # Logic to retrieve prospect stats from ESPN or other sources
        pass

    def identify_call_up_candidates(self):
        """Identify prospects with strong performance who might be called up soon."""
        # Analyze team needs, prospect performance, service time considerations
        pass

2.  Recent Call-Up Tracker
    Another important component would track recent minor league call-ups and their immediate performance:
    python
    def track_recent_callups(self, days_back=14):
    """
    Track players recently called up from the minors.
        Args:
            days_back: How many days back to look for call-ups

        Returns:
            DataFrame: Recently called up players and their performance
        """
        # Logic to identify players who recently debuted or were called up
        # Check their initial MLB performance metrics
        pass
3.  Statistical Indicators for Breakouts
    We can implement statistical measures that serve as early indicators of breakout performances:
    python
    def identify_breakout_indicators(self, min_appearances=20):
    """
    Find players showing statistical indicators of potential breakouts.
        Looks for:
        - Significant K% decreases for batters
        - Velocity increases for pitchers
        - Large discrepancies between performance and expected metrics
        - Significant role changes (e.g., moving up in batting order)

        Args:
            min_appearances: Minimum PA or BF to qualify

        Returns:
            DataFrame: Players with breakout indicators
        """
        # Logic to identify statistical breakout indicators
        pass
4.  Social Media and News Monitoring
    The industry buzz around prospects often precedes their breakout. We could add a module to monitor industry sources:
    python
    def monitor_prospect_buzz(self):
    """
    Monitor baseball news sources and social media for prospect mentions.
        Returns:
            DataFrame: Prospects with increasing mentions from reliable sources
        """
        # Logic to track mentions from reliable baseball analysts and news sources
        pass
5.  Contextual Opportunity Analysis
    Team context matters greatly for prospect success:
    python
    def analyze_opportunity_context(self):
    """
    Analyze which teams have situations favorable for prospect call-ups.
        Examines:
        - Teams with injuries at key positions
        - Teams with underperforming players at positions with top prospects
        - Teams falling out of contention who might promote youth

        Returns:
            DataFrame: Teams with favorable call-up situations and top prospects
        """
        # Logic to match team needs with prospect opportunities
        pass
    Implementation Plan
    To put this into action, I recommend:

First, we could develop a dashboard that combines manual data entry with automated data retrieval to track the top 50-100 prospects across baseball
Implement automated tracking of key statistical indicators for minor league players to find those outperforming expectations
Create a weekly report that highlights:

Recent call-ups and their availability
Prospects with multiple breakout indicators
Players with increasing "buzz" in baseball circles
Players in advantageous team situations

Add alerts for specific events like:

A prospect being called up
A top prospect moving from AA to AAA
A prospect's ownership percentage increasing rapidly
